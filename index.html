            A new study looked at the long-term effects of yoga therapy to see if adding it as <br>
            a supplemental treatment in the management of heart failure is <br> <br>

            Heart failure is a type of cardiovascular disease in which the heart muscle is  <br>
            either too weak or too stiff to efficiently pump blood, resulting in fluid buildup,<br>
            shortness of breath, and other difficulties. The most commonly used <br>
            categorization system for determining the severity of a patient's symptoms is <br>
            the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional categorisation system. <br><br>

            The NYHA system categorises patients into one of four groups based on theirbr  <br>
            physical activity limits, with Class I being the least severe and Class IV being the <br>
            most severe. Ejection fraction is also measured by clinicians to evaluate how <br>
            efficiently the heart pumps blood.
